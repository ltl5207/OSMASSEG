# OSMASSEG

*coming soon*

## Our models reported in the paper
- trained on ACDC, 10% supervised: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eTNFx56Er_94p82a3jRHSNS0g63_MipK/view?usp=sharing
- trained on PDDCA, one-shot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3oLN70NDp7Zdwkx77R1tiJeIQo4wBvv/view?usp=sharing

## Using our code to train
### Synthetic data generation
*please use the matlab codes in the folder:*

You may also use our synthetic data slices from https:// , but only for academic use.
### Pre-trained pseudo-label prediction model training
*please use the python codes in xx folder, the codes are consistent with the official code of TransUNet.*
### Pre-trained GAN for domain adaption
**
### Offline pseudo-label prediction
### Final segmentation model
### Model test
